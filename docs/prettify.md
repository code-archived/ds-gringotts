A simple set of functions that can be used to emphasize text (**bold**, *italic*) or to color text in terminal/notebook
application which typically uses the `..., verbose : bool = True` argument to print. The function creates a bridge
between by translating "human redable" text to "machine translated" format to be interpreted to emphasize the text. The
[`public gist`](https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown/c6b4c51de4d4dac564ecbe0e178955cb) provides a collection of function
and proper citations are provided as discovered.
