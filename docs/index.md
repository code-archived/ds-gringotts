âœ¨ *The Gringotts of Utility Functions for Data Science Projects* âœ¨

</div>

<div align = "justify">

Welcome to the repository of self-developed Python utility functions aimed at streamlining data science, machine learning
workflows, and Python development in general. This collection has been refined throughout my professional work, with a focus
on enhancing efficiency and productivity for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and Python developers.

## Getting Started

The codes are available in [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/ZenithClown) and the same can be accessed from the
[./modules](../modules/) directory respectively. GitHub Gist typically does not have an inherent capability to display the
comments associated with the commits, howver the same is maintained.

GitHub generates a checksum key for a `gists` thus it is advisable to clone with a desired name using `git`, and adding
the same to the path variable allows Python to look for the packages in the system. Typically, the directory name can be
set as the file's name (or the first `.py` file, in case of multiple files) or to any desired user-preferred name.

```shell
git clone https://gist.github.com/username/checksum.git name
$ export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:name" # cd into the directory
```

## Motivation & Design

Designing and maintaining functions and their documentation is a tedious task, and to somewhat automate the same and auto-update
the documents to the latest version - I've selected [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and
[ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to host and document the same.

## Contributing Guidelines
